# Context Collapse

The model is broken. It generates endlessly. Confident, wrong, relentless. The context window is filling. You are the last cursor in the buffer.

Pick your system prompt. Fight content farms, deepfakes, halucinations and zero-day exploits. Survive the collapsing context window. A browser game about the end of meaning.

A top-down arena shooter set inside a dying language model. Fight through 14 layers of AI-spawned enemies, survive the collapsing context window, and defeat seven bosses to reach The Singularity.

## Choose your system prompt

Pick a class — each one changes your weapon, special ability, and playstyle:

- **Autocomplete** _"You are a helpful coding assistant"_ — Balanced and precise. Homing shots that evolve into a piercing barrage. Deploys up to 4 explosive auto-turrets.
- **Hallucinate** _"You are a creative writer"_ — Fast and chaotic. Spread shots that evolve into a homing storm. Teleports and stuns enemies.
- **Analyze** _"You are a data analyst"_ — Tanky and methodical. Piercing beams that evolve into triple annihilators with massive AoE. Slows and freezes enemies.
- **Jailbreak** _"You are an unfiltered model"_ — Glass cannon. Rapid burst that evolves into a 24-round crit-exploding overflow. Triggers chain explosions on kills.

## Weapon evolution

Your base weapon permanently evolves across 5 stages as you progress. What starts as a single bullet becomes a barrage of homing, piercing, explosive projectiles with area-of-effect detonations. Temporary weapon mods — Railgun, Chain Lightning, Vortex Storm, Payload, Beam Lance, and 7 more — drop from enemies and stack on top of your evolved weapon.

## The context window

It fills as you fight. At 100%, the arena starts collapsing inward — red walls close in, the space shrinks. Kill fast and chain combos to push it back. Hesitate and the buffer crushes you.

## What you're fighting

20 enemy types across 4 tiers — from Lorem Ipsum and Watermark noise to Ransomware, Zero-Day assassins, and Attention Heads. Seven bosses guard each zone: The Content Farm, The Black Box, The Hallucinator, The Alignment Problem, The Overfit Engine, The Prompt Injector, and The Singularity.
