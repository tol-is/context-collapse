# Context Collapse

The context is full. The slop is rising. Nothing is real. Survive anyway.

An arena shooter where you play as a cursor trapped inside a large language model. Fight through 42 layers of AI-generated enemies, survive the collapsing context window, and defeat seven bosses to reach The Singularity.

## How it works

Pick a **system prompt** as your class — each one changes your weapon, special ability, and playstyle:

- **Autocomplete** — balanced, slight homing shots, deploys an auto-turret
- **Hallucinate** — fast and chaotic, spread shots, bonus token drops
- **Analyze** — tanky, piercing shots, slows enemies on scan
- **Jailbreak** — glass cannon, high damage, temporary 3x damage burst

Every zone introduces new enemy types (Lorem Ipsum, Watermark, Clickbait, Bias, Deepfake, Scraper, Overfit) and ends with a boss fight: The Content Farm, The Black Box, The Hallucinator, The Alignment Problem, The Overfit Engine, The Prompt Injector, and The Singularity.

The **context window** fills up as you play. When it hits 100%, the arena starts collapsing inward — kill enemies and chain combos to push it back down.

**Controls:** WASD / arrows to move, space to shoot, E for special ability, M to toggle audio.
